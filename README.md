Installation and Instruction to use:
1. Install both of the files (SourceCode and Food Data Generator) into one folder and make sure Python is properly installed on your computer
2. Run the Food Data Generator.py first to export out the most updated food nutrition data from USDA Website (The food data base only included 100 common food for diet and the list is malleable to adjust to the users liking, you can do this by changing the list in Food Data Generator.py)
3. After exporting the food data as a JSON file, make sure to change the file pathing (line 46) in the Source code to wherever your JSON file is (usually in your python directory)
4. Run the SourceCode and a window will pop up for the user to enter their infomation and a personalized daily diet list will pop up.
